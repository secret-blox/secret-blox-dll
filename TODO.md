sup gamers, please write below needed features and improvements you didn't have time to implement

### Better Logging Service (uniqua)
> instead of using RBX::Printf we should use file operations to logs stuff, for this reason
I suggest the use of a logging service that can be used to log stuff in many formats with a time prefix, such: [HH:MM:SS] [LOGTYPE] [MESSAGE]

We also need to log exceptions in the log file, so we can debug the dlls and the game easier.
